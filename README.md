# Tweet Sentiment Classification
Repository of a experiment comparing different deep learning architectures to classify tweets (binary text classification).

Approches:
  * Embedding layer from scratch;
  * Embedding layers initialized with Glove word embeddings;
  * BERT fine tuning;
  * Sentence embeddings (SentenceTransoformers) + simple MLP;

All of them present almost the same accuracy (~80%), but they differ on the time needed.
